# Epicodus | Week 03 | Word Play

This site will present a form to the user, asking them for a sentence. Then it will use a bunch of array methods to change up that sentence and display it to the user.

## Requirements / Steps
1. Create a form where users may enter a sentence.
2. Turn that sentence into an array using the split method.
3. Then, loop through this array to build a new array out of every word in the sentence that is 3 or more characters in length.
4. Finally, reverse the order of the new array, join it back together into a string, and display it to the user.
